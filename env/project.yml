description: Apps and engines loaded when an Project, Sequence, or Shot is loaded.
  Since std VFX config template has a file system structure which is centered around
  pipeline steps, this environment is largely empty. Most of the work takes place on
  a level in the file system where both an asset and a pipeline step are available
  - e.g Shot Hero, modeling, so all apps for loading, publishing etc. are
  located in the asset environment. This environment mostly contains
  utility apps and the tank work files app, which lets you choose a task to work
  on and load associated content into an application.
